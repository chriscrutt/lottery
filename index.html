        <h1>Hello.</h1>
        <p>The purpose of the Lottery beta project is a proof of concept to create a truly decentralized, plausibly fair
            lottery that is considerably difficult to manipulate. It does this by allowing anyone to run the payout and
            restart function. When running this function, the contract creator and DAO get 1% of the pot each before
            paying out the lottery winner. To incentivize people to continuously and quickly restart the lottery,
            callers of that function earn Lottery Rewards Tokens, or LRTs. These tokens will earn you Ether
            proportionate to the amount of total staked tokens. In other words, if you owned 10% of all LRTs staked and
            the last lottery pot was $10,000... the DAO would earn $10 and you would earn $1.<br><br>
            The LRT payouts work as follows. After the lottery time concludes, callers can earn LRT by running the
            Payout & Restart function (P&R). For every block that passes, the amount of LRT rewarded increases. However,
            the amount it increases each time runs along an exponential decay slope. For example, on the first-ever
            block after the first lottery, 21 tokens are rewarded. If P&R hasn't been run, the next block reward will be
            0.1% less. So if it takes 3 blocks for the lottery to be restarted, the caller will have earned 62.937021
            LRTs. In the next round, the starting reward on the first block will be again 0.1% less. The math works out
            to something like 21 + ∑ 21 * 0.999n where "n" is number of blocks<br><br>
            While I could have had it just allot everyone who owns LRTs Ether, if any LRTs found their way onto a DEX or
            exchange, that Ether would be lost. That is why I made it so that staking only starts once a user either
            manually runs the staking function, or automatically when a caller runs the P&R function. It calculates
            Ether available by combing through each of your LRT transactions, every lottery payout, the total amount of
            LRT staked on that payout, and Ether already withdrawn before paying the caller out.<br><br>
            The winning ticket is calculated by taking the hash of the ending lottery block and the total amount of
            tickets purchased. While some randomizers use the current block's timestamp, the base fee, or gas left in
            the function call, I felt all these could be potentially manipulated after the fact and created too many
            manipulatable variables (which might actually be good).
